### ✅ Citations Proper (lines 2024-2029)
All 6 citations are legitimate peer-reviewed papers:
- Bromley et al. (1993) - Siamese Time Delay Neural Network
- Schroff et al. (2015) - FaceNet
- Snell et al. (2017) - Prototypical Networks
- Koch et al. (2015) - Siamese One-shot Learning
- Wang et al. (2017) - Deep Metric Learning
- Hermans et al. (2017) - Triplet Loss

## Why No Changes Were Needed

### No Unverifiable Claims
- **Search result**: Zero matches for "Real-World Case Studies", company names, or specific deployments
- **Search result**: Zero matches for dollar amounts or specific cost claims
- All content is educational methodology and best practices

### No Fabricated Examples
- All code examples are clearly illustrative implementations
- No claims that code represents real production systems
- Production guidance based on industry best practices, not fake deployments

### Honest Technical Discussion
- Trade-offs stated (e.g., "gradient checkpointing trades 30% compute for 50% memory")
- Guidelines are reasonable best practices (e.g., "cache hit rate > 70%")
- Challenges acknowledged (threshold calibration required, data drift monitoring)

### Proper Academic Foundation
- Every major concept backed by citations
- Technical implementations follow established patterns
- Production patterns align with industry best practices
