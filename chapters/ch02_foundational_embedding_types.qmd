## Chapter Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive tour of foundational embedding types across different data modalities. We examine text, image, audio, video, multi-modal, graph, time-series, and code embeddings—understanding what makes each unique, when to use them, and how they're created. These foundational types form the building blocks that production systems combine and extend using the advanced patterns covered in @sec-advanced-embedding-patterns.

## The Embedding Landscape

Every type of data can be converted to embeddings, but different data types require different approaches. The key insight is that **the embedding architecture must match the structure of your data**:

- **Text** (words, sentences, documents): Transformer models capture context and semantic meaning
- **Images**: CNNs and Vision Transformers capture spatial patterns and visual features
- **Audio** (speech, music, sounds): Spectral models process frequency patterns over time
- **Video**: Temporal models combine frame-level features with motion understanding
- **Multi-modal** (text + images): Alignment models map different modalities to a shared space
- **Graphs** (networks, relationships): Message-passing models aggregate neighborhood information
- **Time-series** (sensors, sequences): Recurrent and convolutional models capture temporal patterns
- **Code** (programs, functions): Specialized models understand syntax and program semantics

Let's explore each embedding type in depth.

## Text Embeddings {#sec-text-embedding-types}

Text embeddings are the most mature and widely used embedding type. They've evolved through several generations:

### Word Embeddings

The foundation of modern NLP, word embeddings map individual words to vectors:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

"""
Word Embeddings: From Words to Vectors

Word embeddings capture semantic relationships between individual words.
Words with similar meanings cluster together in the embedding space.
"""

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

# Use a sentence model to embed individual words
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Embed words across different categories
words = {
    'animals': ['cat', 'dog', 'elephant', 'whale'],
    'vehicles': ['car', 'truck', 'airplane', 'boat'],
    'colors': ['red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'],
}

all_words = [w for group in words.values() for w in group]
embeddings = model.encode(all_words)

# Show that words cluster by category
print("Word similarities (same category = higher similarity):\n")
print("Within categories:")
print(f"  cat ↔ dog:      {cosine_similarity([embeddings[0]], [embeddings[1]])[0][0]:.3f}")
print(f"  car ↔ truck:    {cosine_similarity([embeddings[4]], [embeddings[5]])[0][0]:.3f}")
print(f"  red ↔ blue:     {cosine_similarity([embeddings[8]], [embeddings[9]])[0][0]:.3f}")

print("\nAcross categories:")
print(f"  cat ↔ car:      {cosine_similarity([embeddings[0]], [embeddings[4]])[0][0]:.3f}")
print(f"  dog ↔ red:      {cosine_similarity([embeddings[1]], [embeddings[8]])[0][0]:.3f}")
```

**Key characteristics:**

- One vector per word (static, context-independent in classic models)
- Typically 100-300 dimensions
- Captures synonyms, analogies, and semantic relationships

### Sentence and Document Embeddings

Modern applications need to embed entire sentences or documents:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

"""
Sentence Embeddings: Capturing Complete Thoughts

Sentence embeddings represent the meaning of entire sentences,
enabling semantic search and similarity comparison.
"""

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Sentences with similar meaning but different words
sentences = [
    "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
    "A fast auburn fox leaps above a sleepy canine",
    "Machine learning models require lots of training data",
    "AI systems need substantial amounts of examples to learn",
]

embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

print("Sentence similarities:\n")
print("Similar meaning (paraphrases):")
print(f"  Sentence 1 ↔ 2: {cosine_similarity([embeddings[0]], [embeddings[1]])[0][0]:.3f}")
print(f"  Sentence 3 ↔ 4: {cosine_similarity([embeddings[2]], [embeddings[3]])[0][0]:.3f}")

print("\nDifferent topics:")
print(f"  Sentence 1 ↔ 3: {cosine_similarity([embeddings[0]], [embeddings[2]])[0][0]:.3f}")
```

**When to use text embeddings:**

- Text classification, clustering, and sentiment analysis (see @sec-text-classification-clustering)
- Question answering and RAG systems (see @sec-rag-at-scale)
- Chatbots and conversational AI—intent matching, response selection (see @sec-conversational-ai)
- Summarization—finding representative sentences (see @sec-embedding-summarization)
- Semantic search—finding documents by meaning (see @sec-semantic-search)
- Recommendation systems—content-based filtering (see @sec-recommendation-systems)
- Customer support—ticket routing, finding similar issues (see @sec-cross-industry-patterns)
- Content moderation—detecting similar problematic content (see @sec-content-moderation)
- Duplicate and near-duplicate detection (see @sec-entity-resolution)
- Entity resolution—matching names and descriptions (see @sec-entity-resolution)
- Machine translation—cross-lingual embeddings (see @sec-defense-intelligence)

### Classification, Clustering, and Sentiment Analysis {#sec-text-classification-clustering}

Once you have text embeddings, three foundational tasks become straightforward: **classification** (assigning labels), **clustering** (discovering groups), and **sentiment analysis** (a special case of classification). All three leverage the same principle—similar texts have similar embeddings.

**Classification with embeddings:**

Train a simple classifier on top of frozen embeddings, or use nearest-neighbor approaches. The k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) method shown below works as follows: during training, embed each text and store the embedding alongside its label. To predict a new text's label, embed it, find the k training embeddings most similar to it (using cosine similarity), and return the most common label among those neighbors.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show Text Classifier"
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter


class EmbeddingClassifier:
    """Simple k-NN classifier using embeddings."""

    def __init__(self, encoder, k: int = 5):
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.k = k
        self.embeddings = []
        self.labels = []

    def fit(self, texts: list, labels: list):
        """Embed texts and store with their labels."""
        self.embeddings = [self.encoder.encode(text) for text in texts]
        self.labels = labels

    def predict(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Predict label using k-NN."""
        query_emb = self.encoder.encode(text)

        # Cosine similarity: (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
        distances = []
        for i, emb in enumerate(self.embeddings):
            dist = np.dot(query_emb, emb) / (np.linalg.norm(query_emb) * np.linalg.norm(emb))
            distances.append((dist, self.labels[i]))

        # Get k nearest neighbors
        distances.sort(reverse=True)
        k_nearest = [label for _, label in distances[: self.k]]

        # Return most common label
        return Counter(k_nearest).most_common(1)[0][0]


# Example: Sentiment classification
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

classifier = EmbeddingClassifier(encoder, k=3)
classifier.fit(
    texts=["Great product!", "Loved it", "Terrible", "Waste of money", "Amazing quality"],
    labels=["positive", "positive", "negative", "negative", "positive"],
)
print(f"Prediction: {classifier.predict('This is wonderful!')}")
```

**Clustering with embeddings:**

Clustering discovers natural groups in your data without predefined labels. Since similar texts have similar embeddings, texts on the same topic will cluster together in embedding space.

K-means is a popular clustering algorithm. You specify k (the number of clusters), and the algorithm finds k groups by positioning a *centroid* (center point) for each cluster. Each text belongs to the cluster whose centroid is closest to its embedding.

The algorithm works as follows: first, embed all texts. Then pick k random embeddings as initial centroids—the algorithm needs starting points before it can begin refining. Next, iterate until convergence: (1) assign each embedding to its nearest centroid (measured by Euclidean distance), and (2) update each centroid to be the mean of its assigned embeddings. The algorithm converges when assignments stop changing.

#| echo: false
#| label: fig-kmeans-clustering
#| fig-cap: "K-means clustering in 2D embedding space. Points are colored by cluster assignment, with centroids marked as X."
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cluster3 = np.random.randn(15, 2) * 0.5 + [2, -1.5]
points = np.vstack([cluster1, cluster2, cluster3])

# Compute centroids
centroids = np.array([cluster1.mean(axis=0), cluster2.mean(axis=0), cluster3.mean(axis=0)])

        for text, cluster_id in zip(texts, assignments):

        return clusters


# Example: Topic discovery
texts = [
    # Cooking
    "Chop the onions and garlic finely",
    "Simmer the sauce for twenty minutes",
    "Season with salt and pepper to taste",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees",
    # Space
    "The telescope discovered a new exoplanet",
    "Astronauts completed their spacewalk today",
    "The Mars rover collected soil samples",
    "A new comet is visible this month",
    # Weather
    "Heavy rain expected throughout the weekend",
    "Temperatures will drop below freezing tonight",
    "A warm front is moving in from the south",
    "Clear skies and sunshine forecast for Monday",
]

np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducible results
clusterer = EmbeddingClusterer(encoder, n_clusters=3)
assignments = clusterer.fit(texts)
clusters = clusterer.get_cluster_examples(texts, assignments)
for cluster_id, examples in clusters.items():
    print(f"\nCluster {cluster_id}:")
    for text in examples:
        print(f"  - {text}")
```

Notice that some items may appear in unexpected clusters. Embeddings capture semantic similarity that doesn't always match our intuitive topic categories—"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees" mentions temperature, which may pull it toward weather texts, while "A warm front is moving in" uses directional language similar to space descriptions. This is a feature, not a bug: embeddings capture meaning patterns that humans might overlook.

**Sentiment analysis:**

Sentiment analysis determines whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral opinions. While you could treat this as classification (train on labeled examples), an elegant alternative uses *anchor texts*—words or phrases with known sentiment.

The approach works as follows: embed a set of clearly positive words ("excellent", "amazing", "love it") and compute their centroid. Do the same for negative words. To analyze new text, embed it and measure which centroid it's closer to. The difference in distances gives both a label and a confidence score—text much closer to the positive centroid is strongly positive.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-sentiment-anchors
#| fig-cap: "Sentiment analysis using anchor texts. Positive and negative anchor words form centroids. New text is classified by which centroid it's closer to."
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pos_centroid = pos_anchors.mean(axis=0)

# Negative anchors (left side)
neg_anchors = np.random.randn(5, 2) * 0.3 + [-2, 0.5]
neg_centroid = neg_anchors.mean(axis=0)

# New text to classify (closer to positive)
new_text = np.array([0.8, 0.3])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))

for text in ["This product exceeded expectations!", "Complete waste of money"]:

```

The number in parentheses is the confidence score—the difference between cosine similarities to the positive and negative centroids. These values appear low because general-purpose embeddings capture broad semantics, not just sentiment. The key insight is that the *relative* scores still correctly distinguish positive from negative text, even when absolute differences are small. For production sentiment analysis, you'd typically fine-tune embeddings on sentiment-labeled data (see @sec-custom-embedding-strategies).

## Classification and Clustering Best Practices

**For classification:**

- **Few-shot is often enough**: With good embeddings, 10-50 examples per class often suffices (see @sec-siamese-networks for few-shot techniques)
- **k-NN for simplicity**: No training required, just store examples
- **Logistic regression for speed**: Train a simple linear classifier on embeddings
- **Fine-tune for best quality**: When you have thousands of examples, fine-tune the embedding model itself (see @sec-custom-embedding-strategies)

**For clustering:**

- **Choose k carefully**: Use elbow method or silhouette scores to find optimal cluster count
- **[HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/) for unknown k**: Unlike k-means, HDBSCAN doesn't require specifying cluster count upfront—it discovers clusters based on density and labels sparse points as outliers rather than forcing them into clusters
- **Reduce dimensions first**: For visualization, use UMAP or t-SNE on embeddings
- **Label clusters post-hoc**: Examine cluster members to assign meaningful names

**For sentiment:**

- **Domain matters**: Financial sentiment differs from product reviews—use domain-specific anchors (see @sec-financial-services for financial sentiment)
- **Beyond binary**: Instead of just positive/negative centroids, create centroids for multiple emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise). Measure distance to each and return the closest emotion, or return a distribution across all emotions for nuanced analysis.
- **Aspect-based**: Reviews often mix sentiment across topics ("great battery, terrible screen"). First extract aspects (product features, service elements), then run sentiment analysis on each aspect separately to understand what users love and hate.

## Image Embeddings {#sec-image-embedding-types}

Image embeddings convert visual content into vectors that capture visual semantics—shapes, colors, textures, objects, and spatial relationships. Unlike pixel-by-pixel comparison, embeddings understand that two photos of the same cat are similar even if taken from different angles or lighting conditions.

The example below uses ResNet50 [@he2016resnet], a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet's 1.4 million images. ResNet learns hierarchical visual features—early layers detect edges and textures, middle layers recognize shapes and parts, and deep layers understand objects and scenes. We remove the final classification layer to extract the 2048-dimensional feature vector as our embedding.

print(f"  red ↔ orange: {red_orange:.3f}")
print(f"  red ↔ blue:   {red_blue:.3f}")
```

When comparing image embeddings, we use cosine similarity just like with text. Images with similar visual features—colors, textures, shapes, or objects—will have embeddings that point in similar directions, yielding high similarity scores. The red and orange patterns share warm color features, so their embeddings are closer together than red and blue. In practice, this means a photo of a red dress will be more similar to an orange dress than a blue one, even though all three are "dresses."

How does the model "understand" colors? Images are input as RGB values (three numbers per pixel). Early CNN layers learn filters that activate for specific color combinations—some filters respond to warm tones (high red, medium green, low blue), others to cool tones. As layers get deeper, the network combines color with texture and shape information. By training on millions of labeled images, the model learns that red and orange often appear together (sunsets, autumn leaves, fire) more frequently than red and blue, encoding this statistical relationship in the embedding space.

Beyond colors, early CNN layers also learn edge detectors—filters that respond to boundaries between light and dark regions. For a hands-on introduction to how a single neuron learns to detect edges, see [How Neural Networks Learn to See](https://snowch.github.io/nn_edge_detector_blog.html).

**When to use image embeddings:**

- Visual recommendation systems—suggest visually similar items (see @sec-recommendation-systems)
- Content moderation—detect variations of prohibited images (see @sec-content-moderation)
- Forensic video search—find specific people or objects in footage (see @sec-video-surveillance) *(reverse image lookup)*
- Duplicate and near-duplicate detection—identify copied or modified images (see @sec-entity-resolution) *(reverse image lookup)*
- Medical imaging—find similar X-rays, scans, or pathology slides (see @sec-healthcare-life-sciences)
- Visual product search—find products similar to a photo (see @sec-retail-ecommerce) *(reverse image lookup)*
- Quality control—detect defects by comparing to reference images (see @sec-manufacturing-industry40)
- Face recognition—identify or verify individuals from photos (see @sec-video-surveillance)

There are dozens of other applications including art style matching, stock photo search, image classification, trademark and logo detection, scene recognition, wildlife identification, satellite imagery analysis, document scanning, and autonomous vehicle perception.

## Audio Embeddings {#sec-audio-embedding-types}

Audio embeddings capture acoustic features from speech, music, and environmental sounds. Let's create embeddings from real audio using MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) features:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

"""
Audio Embeddings: Real Audio to Vectors

We'll use librosa to extract MFCC features from actual audio,
creating embeddings that capture timbral characteristics.
"""

import numpy as np
import librosa
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def audio_to_embedding(audio, sr, n_mfcc=20):
    """Convert audio waveform to a fixed-size embedding using MFCCs."""
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sr, n_mfcc=n_mfcc)
    # Aggregate over time: mean and std of each coefficient
    return np.concatenate([mfccs.mean(axis=1), mfccs.std(axis=1)])

# Load librosa's built-in trumpet sample
audio, sr = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet'))
trumpet_embedding = audio_to_embedding(audio, sr)

# Create variations to demonstrate similarity
trumpet_slow = librosa.effects.time_stretch(audio, rate=0.8)
trumpet_pitch_up = librosa.effects.pitch_shift(audio, sr=sr, n_steps=4)

# Generate embeddings for each variation
embeddings = {
    'trumpet_original': trumpet_embedding,
    'trumpet_slower': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_slow, sr),
    'trumpet_higher_pitch': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_pitch_up, sr),
}

print(f"Embedding dimension: {len(trumpet_embedding)} (20 MFCCs × 2 stats)\n")

# Compare similarities
print("Audio embedding similarities:")
sim_slow = cosine_similarity(
    [embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_slower']]
)[0][0]
print(f"  Original ↔ Slower tempo:   {sim_slow:.3f}")

sim_pitch = cosine_similarity(
    [embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_higher_pitch']]
)[0][0]
print(f"  Original ↔ Higher pitch:   {sim_pitch:.3f}")

sim_variations = cosine_similarity(
    [embeddings['trumpet_slower']], [embeddings['trumpet_higher_pitch']]
)[0][0]
print(f"  Slower ↔ Higher pitch:     {sim_variations:.3f}")
```

The tempo change preserves timbre (high similarity), while pitch shifting alters the spectral characteristics more significantly.
