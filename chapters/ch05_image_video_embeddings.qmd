# Image, Audio, and Video Embeddings {#sec-image-video-embeddings}

::: callout-note
## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers embeddings for visual and audio data—images, audio, and video. We explore how these modalities are represented as vectors, when to use each type, and the architectures that create them. An optional advanced section explains how the underlying models learn visual features.

## Image Embeddings {#sec-image-embedding-types}

Image embeddings convert visual content into vectors that capture visual semantics—shapes, colors, textures, objects, and spatial relationships. Unlike pixel-by-pixel comparison, embeddings understand that two photos of the same cat are similar even if taken from different angles or lighting conditions.

### How Images Are Represented

Digital images are stored as 3D arrays with shape (height, width, 3)—the third dimension holds Red, Green, and Blue color intensities for each pixel:

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-image-rgb-cube
#| fig-cap: "An image is a 3D array: height × width × 3 color channels (Red, Green, Blue). Each pixel has three values (0-255)."
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection
import numpy as np

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

w, h, c = 224, 224, 3
scale = 1/224
sw, sh, sc = w * scale, h * scale, c * 0.3

vertices = [
    [0, 0, 0], [sw, 0, 0], [sw, sh, 0], [0, sh, 0],
    [0, 0, sc], [sw, 0, sc], [sw, sh, sc], [0, sh, sc]
]

colors = ['#FF6B6B', '#6BCB77', '#4D96FF']
labels = ['Red channel', 'Green channel', 'Blue channel']

for i, (color, label) in enumerate(zip(colors, labels)):
    z = i * sc / 3 + sc / 6
    slice_verts = [[0, 0, z], [sw, 0, z], [sw, sh, z], [0, sh, z]]
    ax.add_collection3d(Poly3DCollection([slice_verts], alpha=0.7, facecolor=color, edgecolor='black', linewidth=1))
    ax.text(sw + 0.1, sh/2, z, label, fontsize=9)

for i, j in [(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,0), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,4), (0,4), (1,5), (2,6), (3,7)]:
    ax.plot3D(*zip(vertices[i], vertices[j]), 'k-', alpha=0.3, linewidth=0.5)

ax.set_xlabel('Width (224 px)', fontsize=10)
ax.set_ylabel('Height (224 px)', fontsize=10)
ax.set_zlabel('Channels', fontsize=10)
ax.set_title('Image as a 3D array: (224, 224, 3)', fontsize=11, fontweight='bold')
ax.view_init(elev=20, azim=45)
ax.set_box_aspect([1, 1, 0.3])
ax.set_xticks([])
ax.set_yticks([])
ax.set_zticks([])
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Creating Image Embeddings

The example below uses ResNet50 [@he2016resnet], a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet's 1.4 million images. ResNet learns hierarchical visual features—early layers detect edges and textures, middle layers recognize shapes and parts, and deep layers understand objects and scenes. We remove the final classification layer to extract the 2048-dimensional feature vector as our embedding.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

print(f"  red ↔ blue:   {red_blue:.3f}")
```

## RGB Input vs Embedding Output
Don't confuse the 3-channel RGB input with the embedding output. ResNet50 takes the 3 RGB channels as input but produces a **2048-dimensional** embedding vector that captures far more than color: edges, textures, shapes, and high-level visual concepts learned from millions of images.

## Audio Embeddings {#sec-audio-embedding-types}

Audio embeddings convert sound into vectors that capture acoustic properties—pitch, timbre, rhythm, and spectral characteristics. Unlike raw waveform comparison, embeddings understand that two recordings of the same spoken word are similar even with different speakers, background noise, or recording equipment.

### How Audio Is Represented

Audio is processed by first splitting into short overlapping frames (typically 25ms), then extracting features from each frame. MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients) is a classic technique that transforms audio into a representation mimicking human hearing.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

"""
Audio Embeddings: Sound as Vectors
"""

import numpy as np
import librosa
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def audio_to_embedding(audio, sr, n_mfcc=20):
    """Convert audio waveform to a fixed-size embedding using MFCCs."""
    # Extract MFCCs: 20 coefficients per time frame
    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sr, n_mfcc=n_mfcc)
    # Aggregate over time: mean captures average timbre, std captures variation
    return np.concatenate([mfccs.mean(axis=1), mfccs.std(axis=1)])

# Load librosa's built-in trumpet sample
audio, sr = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet'))
trumpet_embedding = audio_to_embedding(audio, sr)

# Create variations to demonstrate similarity
trumpet_slow = librosa.effects.time_stretch(audio, rate=0.8)
trumpet_pitch_up = librosa.effects.pitch_shift(audio, sr=sr, n_steps=12)

embeddings = {
    'trumpet_original': trumpet_embedding,
    'trumpet_slower': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_slow, sr),
    'trumpet_higher_pitch': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_pitch_up, sr),
}

print(f"Embedding dimension: {len(trumpet_embedding)} (20 MFCCs × 2 stats)\n")

print("Audio embedding similarities:")
sim_slow = cosine_similarity([embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_slower']])[0][0]
print(f"  Original ↔ Slower tempo:   {sim_slow:.3f}")

sim_pitch = cosine_similarity([embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_higher_pitch']])[0][0]
print(f"  Original ↔ Higher pitch:   {sim_pitch:.3f}")
```

### When to Use Audio Embeddings

## Video Embeddings {#sec-video-embedding-types}

Video embeddings convert video clips into vectors that capture both visual content and temporal dynamics—actions, motion patterns, scene transitions, and narrative flow. Unlike image embeddings that capture a single moment, video embeddings understand that "sitting down" and "standing up" are different actions even though individual frames might look similar.

### How Video Is Represented

Videos add a fourth dimension to images: time. A video is a sequence of frames, each of which is an image. The simplest approach extracts image embeddings from sampled frames and aggregates them:

```{python}
#| code-fold: false

            emb = feature_extractor(tensor).squeeze().numpy()

## Advanced: How Visual Models Learn {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note}
## Optional Section
This section explains how image embedding models learn visual features. Understanding these fundamentals helps you choose the right model and fine-tune for your domain. Skip this if you just need to use embeddings.
:::

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs learn hierarchical visual features through layers of convolution operations:

- **Early layers** detect edges and textures—horizontal lines, vertical lines, gradients
- **Middle layers** combine edges into shapes—corners, curves, patterns
- **Deep layers** recognize objects—faces, cars, animals

Each convolutional filter acts as a pattern detector, sliding across the image and activating when it finds its learned pattern. Through training on millions of labeled images, these filters learn increasingly abstract representations.

### Vision Transformers (ViT)

Vision Transformers apply the same attention mechanism from text to images by:

1. **Splitting the image into patches** (e.g., 16×16 pixels each)
2. **Treating each patch as a "token"** (like words in text)
3. **Applying transformer layers** to learn relationships between patches

This allows ViT to capture long-range dependencies—understanding that distant parts of an image are related—which CNNs struggle with due to their local receptive fields.

### Transfer Learning

Most applications don't train image models from scratch. Instead:

1. Start with a model pre-trained on ImageNet (1.4M labeled images)
2. Remove the classification head to get feature vectors
3. Optionally fine-tune on your domain-specific data

This works because low-level features (edges, textures) transfer across domains—a model that learned to detect edges on ImageNet can detect edges in medical images or satellite photos.

## Key Takeaways

- **Image embeddings** capture visual semantics—similar objects, colors, and textures cluster together regardless of exact pixel values

- **Audio embeddings** capture acoustic properties—timbre, rhythm, and spectral features that identify sounds across variations

- **Video embeddings** combine spatial and temporal information—understanding both what's in each frame and how things change over time

- **CNNs** learn hierarchical features through convolution layers; **Vision Transformers** use attention to capture long-range relationships

- **Transfer learning** is standard practice—start with pre-trained models and adapt to your domain

## Looking Ahead

Now that you understand single-modality embeddings for text, images, audio, and video, @sec-multimodal-embeddings explores how to combine these modalities into unified multi-modal representations.
