## Chapter Overview
Scientific computing—from astrophysics to climate science to materials discovery—faces challenges of extreme data scales, complex physical constraints, and multi-modal observations spanning instruments worldwide. This chapter applies embeddings to scientific frontiers: astrophysics applications using image and spectral embeddings to classify galaxies, detect gravitational waves, and discover exoplanets from telescope data at petabyte scale, climate and earth science with spatio-temporal embeddings for weather prediction, climate modeling, and satellite imagery analysis, materials science acceleration using atomic graph embeddings to predict material properties and discover novel compounds, particle physics analysis with point cloud embeddings for collision reconstruction and anomaly detection at the Large Hadron Collider, and ecology and biodiversity monitoring through audio, image, and DNA sequence embeddings for species identification and ecosystem health assessment. These techniques transform scientific discovery from manual analysis and limited sampling to automated pattern recognition across the full scale of observational data.

After transforming media and entertainment (@sec-media-entertainment), embeddings enable **scientific computing breakthroughs** at unprecedented scale. Traditional scientific analysis relies on domain expert interpretation, physics-based simulations, and manual feature engineering. **Embedding-based scientific computing** learns representations directly from observational data—telescope images, sensor networks, particle detectors, genomic sequences—discovering patterns that complement and extend physics-based understanding while scaling to the petabyte datasets modern instruments generate.

## Astrophysics and Astronomy

Astronomy generates massive observational datasets—the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will produce 20 terabytes per night, while the Square Kilometre Array will generate more data than the global internet. **Embedding-based astrophysics** enables automated classification, anomaly detection, and discovery across these datasets.

### The Astrophysics Challenge

Traditional astronomical analysis faces limitations:

- **Data volume**: Human experts cannot review billions of galaxy images
- **Rare events**: Transient phenomena (supernovae, gravitational waves) require real-time detection
- **Multi-wavelength**: Combining radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations
- **Spectral complexity**: High-dimensional spectra require sophisticated analysis
- **Simulation gaps**: Physics simulations cannot cover full parameter space

**Embedding approach**: Learn representations of celestial objects from images, spectra, and light curves. Similar objects cluster in embedding space; anomalies appear as outliers. Enable cross-survey matching and rapid classification of new observations.
