## Why This Book?

Embeddings have evolved from an academic curiosity to the foundational technology powering the next generation of AI applications. Organizations that master embeddings at scale are building competitive moats that are nearly impossible to replicate. This book provides the complete roadmap from strategy to implementation.

## What You'll Learn

- **Strategic Foundation**: Understanding embeddings as a competitive advantage and designing enterprise-scale architectures
- **Custom Development**: Moving beyond pre-trained models to build embeddings tailored to your domain
- **Production Engineering**: Scaling embedding systems to handle trillions of rows with high performance
- **Advanced Applications**: Implementing RAG, semantic search, recommendations, and anomaly detection at scale
- **Industry-Specific Solutions**: Real-world applications across finance, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and media
- **Future-Proofing**: Optimization, security, monitoring, and preparing for emerging technologies
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Practical guidance for organizational transformation and deployment

## Prerequisites

This book assumes:

- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with database systems
- Experience with Python or similar programming languages
- Understanding of distributed systems (helpful but not required)
