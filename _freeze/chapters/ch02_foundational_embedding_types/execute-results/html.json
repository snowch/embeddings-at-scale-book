We examine text, image, audio, video, multi-modal, graph, time-series, and code embeddings—understanding what makes each unique, when to use them, and how they're created. These foundational types form the building blocks that production systems combine and extend using the advanced patterns covered in @sec-advanced-embedding-patterns.\n:::\n\n## The Embedding Landscape\n\nEvery type of data can be converted to embeddings, but different data types require different approaches. The key insight is that **the embedding architecture must match the structure of your data**:\n\n- **Text** (words, sentences, documents): Transformer models capture context and semantic meaning\n- **Images**: CNNs and Vision Transformers capture spatial patterns and visual features\n- **Audio** (speech, music, sounds): Spectral models process frequency patterns over time\n- **Video**: Temporal models combine frame-level features with motion understanding\n- **Multi-modal** (text + images): Alignment models map different modalities to a shared space\n- **Graphs** (networks, relationships): Message-passing models aggregate neighborhood information\n- **Time-series** (sensors, sequences): Recurrent and convolutional models capture temporal patterns\n- **Code** (programs, functions): Specialized models understand syntax and program semantics\n\nLet's explore each embedding type in depth.\n\n## Text Embeddings {#sec-text-embedding-types}\n\nText embeddings are the most mature and widely used embedding type.

become straightforward: **classification** (assigning labels), **clustering** (discovering groups), and **sentiment analysis** (a special case of classification). All three leverage the same principle—similar texts have similar embeddings.\n\n**Classification with embeddings:**\n\nTrain a simple classifier on top of frozen embeddings, or use nearest-neighbor approaches. The k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) method shown below works as follows: during training, embed each text and store the embedding alongside its label. To predict a new text's label, embed it, find the k training embeddings most similar to it (using cosine similarity), and return the most common label among those neighbors.\n\n::: {#673a12ed .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show Text Classifier\"}\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n\nclass EmbeddingClassifier:\n    \"\"\"Simple k-NN classifier using embeddings.\"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, encoder, k: int = 5):\n        self.encoder = encoder\n        self.k = k\n        self.embeddings = []\n        self.labels = []\n\n    def fit(self, texts: list, labels: list):\n        \"\"\"Embed texts and store with their labels.\"\"\"\n        self.embeddings = [self.encoder.encode(text) for text in texts]\n        self.labels = labels\n\n    def predict(self, text: str) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Predict label using k-NN.\"\"\"\n        query_emb = self.encoder.encode(text)\n\n        # Cosine similarity: (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)\n        distances = []\n        for i, emb in enumerate(self.embeddings):\n            dist = np.dot(query_emb, emb) / (np.linalg.norm(query_emb) * np.linalg.norm(emb))\n            distances.append((dist, self.labels[i]))\n\n        # Get k nearest neighbors\n        distances.sort(reverse=True)\n        k_nearest = [label for _, label in distances[: self.k]]\n\n        # Return most common label\n        return Counter(k_nearest).most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n\n# Example: Sentiment classification\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nencoder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')\n\nclassifier = EmbeddingClassifier(encoder, k=3)\nclassifier.fit(\n    texts=[\"Great product!\", \"Loved it\", \"Terrible\", \"Waste of money\", \"Amazing quality\"],\n    labels=[\"positive\", \"positive\", \"negative\", \"negative\", \"positive\"],\n)\nprint(f\"Prediction: {classifier.predict('This is wonderful!')}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPrediction: positive\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Clustering with embeddings:**\n\nClustering discovers natural groups in your data without predefined labels. Since similar texts have similar embeddings, texts on the same topic will cluster together in embedding space.\n\nK-means is a popular clustering algorithm. You specify k (the number of clusters), and the algorithm finds k groups by positioning a *centroid* (center point) for each cluster. Each text belongs to the cluster whose centroid is closest to its embedding.\n\nThe algorithm works as follows: first, embed all texts. Then pick k random embeddings as initial centroids—the algorithm needs starting points before it can begin refining. Next, iterate until convergence: (1) assign each embedding to its nearest centroid (measured by Euclidean distance), and (2) update each centroid to be the mean of its assigned embeddings. The algorithm converges when assignments stop changing.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-kmeans-clustering .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![K-means clustering in 2D embedding space.

Embeddings capture semantic similarity that doesn't always match our intuitive topic categories—\"Preheat the oven to 350 degrees\" mentions temperature, which may pull it toward weather texts, while \"A warm front is moving in\" uses directional language similar to space descriptions. This is a feature, not a bug: embeddings capture meaning patterns that humans might overlook.\n\n**Sentiment analysis:**\n\nSentiment analysis determines whether text expresses positive, negative, or neutral opinions. While you could treat this as classification (train on labeled examples), an elegant alternative uses *anchor texts*—words or phrases with known sentiment.\n\nThe approach works as follows: embed a set of clearly positive words (\"excellent\", \"amazing\", \"love it\") and compute their centroid. Do the same for negative words. To analyze new text, embed it and measure which centroid it's closer to. The difference in distances gives both a label and a confidence score—text much closer to the positive centroid is strongly positive.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-sentiment-anchors .cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Sentiment analysis using anchor texts.

These values appear low because general-purpose embeddings capture broad semantics, not just sentiment. The key insight is that the *relative* scores still correctly distinguish positive from negative text, even when absolute differences are small. For production sentiment analysis, you'd typically fine-tune embeddings on sentiment-labeled data (see @sec-custom-embedding-strategies).\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Classification and Clustering Best Practices\n\n**For classification:**\n\n- **Few-shot is often enough**: With good embeddings, 10-50 examples per class often suffices (see @sec-siamese-networks for few-shot techniques)\n- **k-NN for simplicity**: No training required, just store examples\n- **Logistic regression for speed**: Train a simple linear classifier on embeddings\n- **Fine-tune for best quality**: When you have thousands of examples, fine-tune the embedding model itself (see @sec-custom-embedding-strategies)\n\n**For clustering:**\n\n- **Choose k carefully**: Use elbow method or silhouette scores to find optimal cluster count\n- **[HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/) for unknown k**: Unlike k-means, HDBSCAN doesn't require specifying cluster count upfront—it discovers clusters based on density and labels sparse points as outliers rather than forcing them into clusters\n- **Reduce dimensions first**: For visualization, use UMAP or t-SNE on embeddings\n- **Label clusters post-hoc**: Examine cluster members to assign meaningful names\n\n**For sentiment:**\n\n- **Domain matters**: Financial sentiment differs from product reviews—use domain-specific anchors (see @sec-financial-services for financial sentiment)\n- **Beyond binary**: Instead of just positive/negative centroids, create centroids for multiple emotions (joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise). Measure distance to each and return the closest emotion, or return a distribution across all emotions for nuanced analysis.\n- **Aspect-based**: Reviews often mix sentiment across topics (\"great battery, terrible screen\"). First extract aspects (product features, service elements), then run sentiment analysis on each aspect separately to understand what users love and hate.\n:::\n\n## Image Embeddings {#sec-image-embedding-types}\n\nImage embeddings convert visual content into vectors that capture visual semantics—shapes, colors, textures, objects, and spatial relationships. Unlike pixel-by-pixel comparison, embeddings understand that two photos of the same cat are similar even if taken from different angles or lighting conditions.\n\nThe example below uses ResNet50 [@he2016resnet], a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet's 1.4 million images.

Images with similar visual features—colors, textures, shapes, or objects—will have embeddings that point in similar directions, yielding high similarity scores. The red and orange patterns share warm color features, so their embeddings are closer together than red and blue. In practice, this means a photo of a red dress will be more similar to an orange dress than a blue one, even though all three are \"dresses.\"\n\nHow does the model \"understand\" colors? As @fig-rgb-channels shows, each image is stored as three 2D arrays—one for Red, Green, and Blue intensity. The red pattern has high values in the R channel and low values in G and B. Orange combines high R with medium G (red + green = orange).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## RGB Input ≠ Embedding Output\nDon't confuse the 3-channel RGB input with the embedding output. ResNet50 takes the 3 RGB channels as input but produces a **2048-dimensional** embedding vector that captures far more than color: edges, textures, shapes, and high-level visual concepts learned from millions of images.\n:::\n\nThe model receives the three RGB channels as input, and early CNN layers learn filters that activate for specific patterns—some respond to warm tones, others to edges or textures. As layers get deeper, the network combines these low-level features into increasingly abstract representations. By training on millions of labeled images, the model learns that red and orange often appear together (sunsets, autumn leaves, fire) more frequently than red and blue, encoding this statistical relationship across all 2048 dimensions.\n\nBeyond colors, early CNN layers also learn edge detectors—filters that respond to boundaries between light and dark regions.

Unlike raw waveform comparison, embeddings understand that two recordings of the same spoken word are similar even with different speakers, background noise, or recording equipment.\n\nThe example below uses MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), a classic signal processing technique—not a neural network, but a fixed mathematical transformation that extracts acoustic features. MFCCs transform audio into a representation that mimics human hearing—emphasizing frequencies we're sensitive to while compressing less important details. While modern systems use learned embeddings from models like Wav2Vec2, MFCCs remain useful as a baseline and for understanding what acoustic features matter.\n\nWe extract 20 values per time frame, called *coefficients*—each describes a different aspect of the sound's frequency content (overall loudness, balance between low and high frequencies, etc.). Since audio clips vary in length (a 3-second clip has more frames than a 1-second clip), we aggregate across time using mean and standard deviation to create a fixed-size embedding that works regardless of duration:\n\n::: {#cell-fig-mfcc-aggregation .cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![MFCC aggregation: 20 coefficients per frame become a 40-dimensional embedding via mean and standard deviation.](ch02_foundational_embedding_types_files/figure-html/fig-mfcc-aggregation-output-1.png){#fig-mfcc-aggregation width=950 height=470}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#6a267ffb .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n\"\"\"\nAudio Embeddings: Sound as Vectors\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport librosa\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\ndef audio_to_embedding(audio, sr, n_mfcc=20):\n    \"\"\"Convert audio waveform to a fixed-size embedding using MFCCs.\"\"\"\n    # Extract MFCCs: 20 coefficients per time frame\n    mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sr, n_mfcc=n_mfcc)\n    # Aggregate over time: mean captures average timbre, std captures variation\n    return np.concatenate([mfccs.mean(axis=1), mfccs.std(axis=1)])\n\n# Load librosa's built-in trumpet sample\naudio, sr = librosa.load(librosa.ex('trumpet'))\ntrumpet_embedding = audio_to_embedding(audio, sr)\n\n# Create variations to demonstrate similarity\ntrumpet_slow = librosa.effects.time_stretch(audio, rate=0.8)\ntrumpet_pitch_up = librosa.effects.pitch_shift(audio, sr=sr, n_steps=12)  # One octave up\n\n# Generate embeddings for each variation\nembeddings = {\n    'trumpet_original': trumpet_embedding,\n    'trumpet_slower': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_slow, sr),\n    'trumpet_higher_pitch': audio_to_embedding(trumpet_pitch_up, sr),\n}\n\nprint(f\"Embedding dimension: {len(trumpet_embedding)} (20 MFCCs × 2 stats)\\n\")\n\n# Compare similarities\nprint(\"Audio embedding similarities:\")\nsim_slow = cosine_similarity(\n    [embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_slower']]\n)[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Original ↔ Slower tempo:   {sim_slow:.3f}\")\n\nsim_pitch = cosine_similarity(\n    [embeddings['trumpet_original']], [embeddings['trumpet_higher_pitch']]\n)[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Original ↔ Higher pitch:   {sim_pitch:.3f}\")\n\nsim_variations = cosine_similarity(\n    [embeddings['trumpet_slower']], [embeddings['trumpet_higher_pitch']]\n)[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Slower ↔ Higher pitch:     {sim_variations:.3f}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nEmbedding dimension: 40 (20 MFCCs × 2 stats)\n\nAudio embedding similarities:\n  Original ↔ Slower tempo:   1.000\n  Original ↔ Higher pitch:   0.978\n  Slower ↔ Higher pitch:     0.980\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen comparing audio embeddings, cosine similarity measures how acoustically similar two sounds are. Notice that all similarities are high (>0.97)—this is by design. MFCCs capture timbre (the trumpet's characteristic \"brassy\" quality) rather than absolute pitch or tempo. The tempo change preserves timbre almost perfectly (1.000), while shifting pitch by an octave causes only a small drop (~0.98) because the overall spectral shape remains trumpet-like. This robustness is useful for applications like speaker identification, where you want to match voices regardless of speaking speed or emotional pitch variations.\n\nHow do MFCCs capture sound? Audio is first split into short overlapping frames (typically 25ms). For each frame, we compute the frequency spectrum, then apply a mel filterbank that groups frequencies into bands matching human perception—more resolution at low frequencies where we hear pitch differences, less at high frequencies. The cepstral coefficients compress this further, capturing the overall \"shape\" of the spectrum. The result: a compact representation of timbre that's robust to volume changes.\n\n**When to use audio embeddings:** Content moderation, audio fingerprinting, speaker identification, music recommendation, podcast and video search, sound event detection, voice cloning detection, acoustic quality control, wildlife monitoring, and medical diagnostics from sounds (coughs, heartbeats).\n\nThis book covers music recommendation with audio embeddings in @sec-recommendation-systems.

Unlike image embeddings that capture a single moment, video embeddings understand that \"a person sitting down\" and \"a person standing up\" are different actions even though individual frames might look similar.\n\nThe challenge with video is combining spatial information (what's in each frame) with temporal information (how things change over time). The simplest approach extracts image embeddings from sampled frames and aggregates them. More sophisticated models process multiple frames together to capture motion directly.\n\nThe example below demonstrates the frame sampling approach: we extract image embeddings from frames sampled throughout a video, then average them to create a single video embedding. Since videos vary in length, aggregation (like we saw with audio) produces a fixed-size embedding regardless of duration.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-video-aggregation .cell execution_count=13}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Video embedding via frame sampling: extract image embeddings from sampled frames, then aggregate into a single video embedding.](ch02_foundational_embedding_types_files/figure-html/fig-video-aggregation-output-1.png){#fig-video-aggregation width=950 height=518}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#7f323509 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n\"\"\"\nVideo Embeddings: From Clips to Vectors\n\"\"\"\n\nimport torch\nimport numpy as np\nfrom torchvision import models, transforms\nfrom torchvision.models import ResNet50_Weights\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n# Suppress download messages\nimport logging\nlogging.getLogger('torch').setLevel(logging.ERROR)\n\n# Load pretrained ResNet50 as frame feature extractor\nweights = ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1\nmodel = models.resnet50(weights=None)\nmodel.load_state_dict(weights.get_state_dict(progress=False))\nmodel.eval()\nfeature_extractor = torch.nn.Sequential(*list(model.children())[:-1])\n\npreprocess = transforms.Compose([\n    transforms.ToTensor(),\n    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),\n])\n\ndef frames_to_video_embedding(frames):\n    \"\"\"Convert a list of frames (as numpy arrays) to a video embedding.\"\"\"\n    frame_embeddings = []\n    for frame in frames:\n        # Convert numpy array to tensor and preprocess\n        if frame.dtype == np.uint8:\n            frame = frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0\n        tensor = preprocess(frame).unsqueeze(0)\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            emb = feature_extractor(tensor).squeeze().numpy()\n        frame_embeddings.append(emb)\n    # Aggregate: mean across all frames\n    return np.mean(frame_embeddings, axis=0)\n\n# Simulate video frames as colored images (224x224 RGB)\n# \"Running video\": frames transition from green (grass) to blue (sky) - outdoor motion\nrunning_frames = [\n    np.full((224, 224, 3), [0.2, 0.6 + i*0.05, 0.2], dtype=np.float32)  # Green to lighter\n    for i in range(5)\n]\n\n# \"Cooking video\": frames stay warm orange/red tones - kitchen scene\ncooking_frames = [\n    np.full((224, 224, 3), [0.8, 0.4 + i*0.02, 0.1], dtype=np.float32)  # Warm tones\n    for i in range(5)\n]\n\n# \"Jogging video\": similar to running - outdoor greens and blues\njogging_frames = [\n    np.full((224, 224, 3), [0.25, 0.55 + i*0.05, 0.25], dtype=np.float32)  # Similar greens\n    for i in range(5)\n]\n\n# Generate video embeddings\nembeddings = {\n    'running': frames_to_video_embedding(running_frames),\n    'cooking': frames_to_video_embedding(cooking_frames),\n    'jogging': frames_to_video_embedding(jogging_frames),\n}\n\nprint(f\"Video embedding dimension: {len(embeddings['running'])}\\n\")\nprint(\"Video embedding similarities:\")\n\nrun_jog = cosine_similarity([embeddings['running']], [embeddings['jogging']])[0][0]\nrun_cook = cosine_similarity([embeddings['running']], [embeddings['cooking']])[0][0]\njog_cook = cosine_similarity([embeddings['jogging']], [embeddings['cooking']])[0][0]\n\nprint(f\"  Running ↔ Jogging: {run_jog:.3f}  (similar outdoor scenes)\")\nprint(f\"  Running ↔ Cooking: {run_cook:.3f}  (different scenes)\")\nprint(f\"  Jogging ↔ Cooking: {jog_cook:.3f}  (different scenes)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nVideo embedding dimension: 2048\n\nVideo embedding similarities:\n  Running ↔ Jogging: 0.995  (similar outdoor scenes)\n  Running ↔ Cooking: 0.807  (different scenes)\n  Jogging ↔ Cooking: 0.808  (different scenes)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhen comparing video embeddings, similar activities and scenes cluster together.

Graph embeddings learn representations where connected nodes (or nodes with similar neighborhoods) have similar vectors.\n\nThe key insight is that a node's meaning comes from its connections. In a social network, people with similar friends likely have similar interests. In a molecule, atoms with similar bonding patterns have similar chemical properties. Graph embedding algorithms capture this by aggregating information from neighbors.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-graph-embedding .cell execution_count=17}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Graph embeddings: nodes in the same community (densely connected) map to nearby points in embedding space.](ch02_foundational_embedding_types_files/figure-html/fig-graph-embedding-output-1.png){#fig-graph-embedding width=950 height=373}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#a7af832f .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n\"\"\"\nGraph Embeddings: Network Structure as Vectors\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n# Simulated node embeddings from a social network\n# Real systems use Node2Vec, GraphSAGE, or GNN-based approaches\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Two friend groups: nodes in the same group have similar embeddings\nnode_embeddings = {\n    # Community 1: Alice, Bob, Carol (densely connected)\n    'Alice': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([1, 0] + [0]*62),\n    'Bob': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([0.9, 0.1] + [0]*62),\n    'Carol': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([0.8, 0.2] + [0]*62),\n    # Community 2: Xavier, Yuki, Zara (densely connected)\n    'Xavier': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([0, 1] + [0]*62),\n    'Yuki': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([0.1, 0.9] + [0]*62),\n    'Zara': np.random.randn(64) + np.array([0.2, 0.8] + [0]*62),\n}\n\nprint(\"Graph embedding similarities:\\n\")\nprint(\"Within community (friends):\")\nab = cosine_similarity([node_embeddings['Alice']], [node_embeddings['Bob']])[0][0]\nac = cosine_similarity([node_embeddings['Alice']], [node_embeddings['Carol']])[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Alice ↔ Bob:   {ab:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"  Alice ↔ Carol: {ac:.3f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nAcross communities (not connected):\")\nax = cosine_similarity([node_embeddings['Alice']], [node_embeddings['Xavier']])[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Alice ↔ Xavier: {ax:.3f}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGraph embedding similarities:\n\nWithin community (friends):\n  Alice ↔ Bob:   0.056\n  Alice ↔ Carol: 0.000\n\nAcross communities (not connected):\n  Alice ↔ Xavier: -0.035\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNodes in the same community have high similarity because they share connections.

Two sensors with similar behavior patterns (e.g., both showing daily cycles) will have similar embeddings, even if their absolute values differ.\n\nThe challenge with time-series is capturing patterns at multiple scales: short-term fluctuations, medium-term trends, and long-term seasonality. Like audio, time-series vary in length, so embeddings must aggregate temporal information into fixed-size vectors.\n\nThe example below demonstrates a simple statistical approach: extract features that summarize the time-series behavior. More sophisticated methods use learned representations from LSTMs, Transformers, or contrastive learning.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-timeseries-patterns .cell execution_count=19}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Time-series patterns: sine waves and upward trends have distinct signatures that embeddings capture.](ch02_foundational_embedding_types_files/figure-html/fig-timeseries-patterns-output-1.png){#fig-timeseries-patterns width=952 height=278}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#7f46a52f .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n\"\"\"\nTime-Series Embeddings: Temporal Patterns as Vectors\n\"\"\"\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\ndef generate_pattern(pattern_type, length=100):\n    \"\"\"Generate synthetic time-series with specific patterns.\"\"\"\n    t = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, length)\n    if pattern_type == 'sine':\n        return np.sin(t) + np.random.randn(length) * 0.1\n    elif pattern_type == 'increasing':\n        return t/10 + np.random.randn(length) * 0.2\n    else:\n        return np.random.randn(length)\n\ndef timeseries_embedding(series):\n    \"\"\"Extract statistical features as a simple embedding.\"\"\"\n    return np.array([\n        np.mean(series),                              # level\n        np.std(series),                               # variability\n        np.max(series) - np.min(series),              # range\n        np.mean(np.diff(series)),                     # trend (avg change)\n        np.corrcoef(series[:-1], series[1:])[0, 1],   # autocorrelation\n    ])\n\n# Generate time-series with different patterns\npatterns = {\n    'sine_wave_1': generate_pattern('sine'),\n    'sine_wave_2': generate_pattern('sine'),\n    'trend_up_1': generate_pattern('increasing'),\n    'trend_up_2': generate_pattern('increasing'),\n}\n\nembeddings = {name: timeseries_embedding(ts) for name, ts in patterns.items()}\n\nprint(f\"Embedding dimension: {len(embeddings['sine_wave_1'])} (5 statistical features)\\n\")\nprint(\"Time-series embedding similarities:\\n\")\nprint(\"Same pattern type:\")\nsine_sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings['sine_wave_1']], [embeddings['sine_wave_2']])[0][0]\ntrend_sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings['trend_up_1']], [embeddings['trend_up_2']])[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Sine wave 1 ↔ Sine wave 2: {sine_sim:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"  Trend up 1 ↔ Trend up 2:   {trend_sim:.3f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nDifferent pattern types:\")\ncross_sim = cosine_similarity([embeddings['sine_wave_1']], [embeddings['trend_up_1']])[0][0]\nprint(f\"  Sine wave ↔ Trend up:      {cross_sim:.3f}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nEmbedding dimension: 5 (5 statistical features)\n\nTime-series embedding similarities:\n\nSame pattern type:\n  Sine wave 1 ↔ Sine wave 2: 1.000\n  Trend up 1 ↔ Trend up 2:   0.998\n\nDifferent pattern types:\n  Sine wave ↔ Trend up:      0.943\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTime-series with the same pattern type have high similarity because they share statistical properties (similar autocorrelation for sine waves, similar trend for increasing patterns).

Two functions that sum a list of numbers should have similar embeddings whether implemented with a loop or the built-in `sum()` function.\n\nThe challenge with code is that syntax varies widely while functionality remains the same. Variable names, formatting, and implementation choices differ between programmers, but the underlying logic may be identical. Code embeddings must see through surface differences to capture semantic similarity.\n\nThe example below uses a general text model for demonstration.
